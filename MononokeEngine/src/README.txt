OBJECTIVES:

    = (very) Simple ECS System.
        - Systems for only one component
        - Max of one component of a type per entity
        
    = Focus on 2D, grid-based games
    
    = Offer a collection of data structures and pathfinding algorithms
        - Dijkstra (maybe)
        - A*
        - JPS and/or JPS+
        - Binary heaps and pathfinding-optimized binary heaps
        
    = Simple and easy to use collision system
